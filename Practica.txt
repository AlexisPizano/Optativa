Honestly, I don't like to look towards the future or make many plans because no one knows if they will still be alive or not, so I prefer to just enjoy and see what happens. I wouldn't like to stay in Colima because there is very little work, but I really like the city and I would like to try somewhere else, and no, I wouldn't really like to study a master's degree, but time will tell.
